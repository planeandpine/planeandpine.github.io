<h2>How to Use Oils</h2>
<p>
When I first received my oils, knowing how to use them was a large point of confusion and frustration. I had solid resources, but did not feel like I had a good grasp on how to use my oils. This reason is is what inspired me for this site: so YOU can avoid having to going through the same “discovery” process I did.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a list of ways I use my oils:
[For specifics on how I use each oil individually, click <a href="breakdown.html">HERE</a>]
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
      <strong>Diffusion:</strong> Easily one of the most common ways to use oils. You simply fill up your diffuser with water and a few drops of an essential oil or even a blend of essential oils. Ultrasonic diffusers have ultrasonic vibrations which separate water particles and disperses the essential oil and negatively charged particles into the air as a mist. This leads to surrounding air that is both fragrant and purified. Some examples of diffusion benefits: Lavender diffusion provides a relaxing atmosphere that promotes good sleep. Lemon or Citrus Fresh makes your area smell like it has recently been freshly cleaned. Diffusing Raven in the morning promotes a scent that will wake you up and get you ready to jump into the day.

<p>
<strong>Topical:</strong> Rub on your face, neck, chest, back, wrists, feet... Some oils provide a cooling sensation to resolve pain. Some oils do wonder in your skincare routine. Some oils helps relieve muscle cramps. Some help clear sinus and chest congestion. Some oils can help take away headaches (seriously, I use them all the time for this purpose). Some oils help wound care. And some oils work as a great natural perfume (cause why would do we use harsh chemicals to make us smell good when the best scents out there are COMPLETELY NATURAL?!). Remember, oils are powerful and some need to be diluted before putting on your skin!!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Consumption:</strong> [WARNING: Not all oils are meant to be consumed. At Young Living, the white bottles that end with the word “Vitality” are all safe to consume as directed]. Consumption is an obvious way to glean benefits from oils as the effects are similar (but often more exaggerated) than if we ate the plant as a part of our regular diet. These oils often promote good digestion, but can also work to alleviate dental, mouth, or throat pain. Some oils work as natural teeth whiteners when added to your toothbrush! You can also use these oils as great natural flavors to spice up your drinks (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, lavender..) or even your cooking (basil, rosemary, clove, black pepper, ginger..) Please use caution and follow directions when consuming oils!!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Simply Inhaling:</strong> You don’t have to have a diffuser on hand to get the effects of inhaling your oils... simply open the bottle and take a whiff. I tend to do this more when starting to feel anxious. This is also useful if your stuck in a room with unpleasant odors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the Shower:</strong> Yes, yes, YES! Easily one of my favorite ways to use my essential oils is to put a couple of drops near my feet while taking a shower. The steam allows you to get a full effect of the oil, often providing an uplifting atmosphere. For those of you that want to be serious about how to begin your day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the Bath:</strong> Mix a couple drops of essential oils with epsom salt and sink into a relaxing bath experience to help relieve muscle tension, joint inflammation, tension headaches, abdominal cramps, or just to soak your tired feet after a long, hard day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hair + Skin Care:</strong> Frankincense and Lavender (as well as a handful of other oils) have amazing benefits for your skin including acne, toning, and reducing wrinkles. I’ve added them to my moisturizers and makeups. You can also add a couple drops to your hair products to add strength and shine. And just because they are oils, does not mean they are “oily”... I’ve never felt greasy after using an essential oil in my beauty routine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cleaning:</strong> Create natural cleaning conconctions or add to your previous cleaners for antiseptic, grease targeting, and natural deodorizing properties. I also add a few drops of lemon to the bottom of each trash bag and in my garbage disposal when it needs a serious scent-boost. You can also add a couple drops to a tissue and place it in the vent of your car for a refreshing aroma. BOOM. Nailed it. Add essential oils while washing your dirty laundry. Lastly, use essential oils to make an air-freshening spray for your couches, blankets, and pillows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aromatherapy Massages:</strong> Mix a couple of drops with a carrier oil and get the best massage of your life. Need I say more?

<h2>The Science Behind Essential Oils</h2>
<p>
I have no intention to say things aren’t actually scientifically sound.
</p>
<p>
The truth is our bodies are complex and oils work in different ways depending on their properties and how you use them. Here I’ll go in depth of a couple ways essential oils affect our bodies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our peripheral nervous system (PNS) has nerve fibers that cover every nook and cranny of our bodies. These nerves play a role in our muscle movement, but also helps us process the outside world. There are peripheral receptors to detect pressure, temperature, and pain. One type of receptor has a protein called TRPM8, which responds to cold temperatures and tell our brain that we are “feel” something cold. The thing about TRPM8 is that it also responds to a chemical called Menthol, which in turn makes the body think it is touching something cold. Oils like Peppermint and Panaway contain Menthol, which is why, when applied to the body, we feel a cooling sensation. This in turns relieves muscle aches and, when applied to the temples, can possibly fix a headache.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Copaiba is an oil produced from the Copaiba tree in South America. It’s main component is a chemical called caryophyllene. Caryophyllene acts by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxgenase (COX), which in turns inhibits lipid mediators called prostaglandins. Prostaglandin inhibition leads to pain, fever, and inflammation reduction. This is also how Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs such as Aleve, Motrin, and Aspirin) work.
Note: this active ingredient is also in the oils Clove, Basil, Black pepper, and Ylang-ylang.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The brain is extremely complex, and as far as scientific development has come over the years, there is still a lot to be discovered. One thing we do know of is the connection between smell, memory, and emotion. The limbic system is made of the olfactory bulb (the region of your brain that receives smell), the amygdala (largely responsible for emotions), the hippocampus (which is involved in long-term memory processing), and the hypothalamus (which plays various roles in sleep, hunger, pain, and arousal / motivation / attention). Have you ever smelled something that immediately and unexplainably “brought you back” to a previous time or memory? This is the limbic system at work. Aromatherapy is grounded because our sense of smell is uniquely linked to our memory and emotions.
