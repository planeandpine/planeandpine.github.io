<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
My goal for this site is to give you a succinct, centralized, and complete rundown on what you need to know about essential oils. What essential oils do. How to use oils in your daily life. The science behind them (I was a Human Biology major in college, I know this stuff). Where to get them. How to get started. Everything.
</p>
<p>
If you already know you want to get essential oils (ahhem, I’ll give you up to 10% back), click <a href="getting_started.html">HERE</a>

Feel free to bookmark this site and use it as a tool to guide you as you begin your essential oil journey.

<h2>What Are Essential Oils and What Do They Do</h2>
<p>
First, let’s talk about what essential oils DO NOT do. I don’t believe essential oils cure cancer, fix infertility, or completely replace modern medicine!! Modern medicine is a gift, but it’s a gift that we need to use wisely (i.e. sparingly). Pharmacy (medications and such) has come a long way to bring about desired effects in the human body, HOWEVER, these desired effects almost always come with a handful of undesired ones.
</p>
<p>
Trust me, even common, everyday, over-the-counter medications do some degree of damage to our bodies. Why do we use them at all, you ask? Well because sometimes the drug benefits simply outweigh the harm. With that being said we should do everything in our power to take care of our bodies in the most natural ways possible (eliminating junk in / on our bodies, exercise, etc.) so we can save pharmacy (the big guns) for when it’s really called for. Which brings me back to oils...
</p>
<p>
Certain plants contain powerful chemical compounds in their roots, leaves, stems, flowers, bark, and/or fruits which can be concentrated through a distillation process, and the benefits utilized.
</p>
<p>
If you’re thinking “well isn’t it a little strange to use plant chemicals for things other than food?” Let me show you ways that we already do!
</p>
<div style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%; text-align: left;">
  <ul>
    <li>Aloe vera, a cactus-like plant, is commonly used to moisturize skin, reduce inflammation, and to heal wounds and burns.</li>
    <li>Peppermint is an herb, often in teas, which can help reduce nausea, indigestion, and common cold symptoms</li>
    <li>Flaxseed is used as a natural laxative and also contains omega-3 fatty acids that can ease arthritis pain</li>
    <li>Blueberries are chalked full of antioxidants (which reduce bad free radicals in the body) and also contain proanthocyanidins, which help prevent UTIs</li>
    <li>Garlic contains a compound called Allicin which can be used as a natural antibiotic and antifungal agent</li>
    <li>Clove is an herb that has many benefits both when ingested and applied topically. It can reduce nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and diarrhea. Topically, it is used as a numbing agent to reduce dental, mouth, and throat pain (much like Orajel or cough drops). It is also a natural insect repellent!</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Some powerful over-the-counter and prescribed medications also use plant compounds</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The digitalis plant gives us Digoxin, a medication used for congestive heart failure</li>
    <li>Cocoa beans produce Theophylline, which is commonly found in drugs for asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</li>
    <li>Eucalyptus oil is commonly in over-the-counter cough and cold medications as well as in topical analgesics</li>
    <li>Tea tree oil, melaleuca alternifolia, is used topically to treat acne, fungal infections (athlete’s foot), lice, insect bites and has other antibacterial properties</li>
    <li>Syrups and lozenges containing elderberry target influenza symptoms and sinus infections</li>
    <li>And the list goes on and on and on</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
Not all of the plants above are made into essential oils, this is just to show that we as a society already heavily incorporate the nature of plants into our lives. The concept of essential oils is not an absurd one!
